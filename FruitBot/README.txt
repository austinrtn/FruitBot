FruitBot is my first attempt at machine learning.  The user describes a fruit or vegetable, 
and the program "guesses" which fruit/vegetable the user is describing (from now on, fruit will be refered to as fruits and vegatbles).  At first, FruitBot will not be 
able to guess more than a banana, as its database(FruitMemory.txt) has not been developed.  If the program guesses incorrectly, it will ask the user 
to input the name of the fruit that the user was describing.  If guessed correcty, the program assigns the name of the fruit that it guessed to fruit that the
user had described.  In both instances, the information is added to the database, making the program more likely to guess the correct fruit next time.
It should be noted that the program is incapable of guessing fruit that does not already exsist in the database, this is why it must learn which fruit have which 
charataristics.  

A person who stumbles upon this program might ask themselves what is the point of such a useless program.  For me, programming has always been about the journey, and not the destination.
I have written this program to better my understanding of machine learning so that I can create more useful and impressive AI programs in the future.
